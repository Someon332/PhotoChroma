# PhotoChroma
A multi-diode laser that can display colors beyond the vast majority of monitors. 

This is a laser diode array that uses diodes of different wavelengths to capture as much of the CIE 1931 chromaticity chart as possible. Exclusions have been made due to cost or complexity, but the goal of this project is to produce a laser that can display colors far beyond ones that are able to be displayed by regular monitors. This is mostly a demonstration peice, but can have some use in color matching in the far green range of colors, a range not able to be reached by most RGB monitors.
